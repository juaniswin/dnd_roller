# dnd_roller

I was reading "Automate the Boring Stuff" at a DnD session and I thought about the dice rolling, although not boring, I wanted to automate it, and here it is! It's not the best, but it works, and slowly getting better! Drop by some comments if you'd like to help!

All advice and support is welcomed.

Thanks for coming!
